# Problem 2: Building up the Campus Map
#
# Before you write any code, write a couple of sentences here 
# describing how you will model this problem as a graph. 

# This is a helpful exercise to help you organize your
# thoughts before you tackle a big design problem!

## step-1: read in the first 2 values in each line of the file and initialize Nodes for each building
## step2: read in the file again, and construct edges from each line
